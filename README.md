# TemDAO

## Introduction
Current World Heritage and Cultural Assets protection models carry severe limitations and inefficiencies at the cost of those who should be the core stakeholders: tourists, locals that are related to the sites, and researchers of culture, history and architecture. We propose a novel organizational structure to address these challenges.  
TemDAO is a decentralized membership collective funding World Heritage and Cultural Assets protection and development. Its mission is to advancing world heritage protection and development in an open and democratic manner. TemDAO will own the intellectual property assets that result from the projects it supports, and members of TemDAO govern the structure and its decision-making processes. Members can join TemDAO by purchasing TEM tokens or earning them through contributions of work or intellectual property.
